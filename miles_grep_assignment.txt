First thing you want to do is put the GrepLab file into winscp then run ubuntu server 


1. Print all lines containing the string Lane
For this question you want to know what a string is, it's characters that are together so you would want to just type in the string after grep which is "Lane"

command: grep Lane GrepLab


2. Print all lines where the person’s first name starts with H
If you use ^ before a letter It will print the lines that start with that letter.

command: grep ^H GrepLab

3. Print all lines ending in three zeros (000)
you want to use the $ after the numbers because it will go to the end of the line and print the lines ending in 000 

command: grep 000$ GrepLab

4. Print all lines that don’t contain 408

when you want to have it so it prints lines that dont contain something use grep -v, the -v makes it so it will exclude lines with whatevers after it  


command: grep -v 408 GrepLab 

5. Print all lines where birthdays are in the year 1935 (be careful of the
date format! it’s MM/DD/YY)

you want to keep in my of the MM/DD/YY format so you can use /35 to only print lines that include that. 

command: grep /35 GrepLab 

6. Print all lines where the phone number is in an area code that starts
with an 8

You want to use the -E after grep the use :8 and [0-9]{2} to get the start of the telephone number then -[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}: to get the rest and at the end make sure you put the : so it just gets the phone number 

command: grep -E ‘:8[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}:’ GrepLab

7. Print all lines containing an uppercase letter, followed by 4 lowercase
letters, a space and one uppercase letter.
Like the last one except you want to use [A-Z] for the first letter being uppercase then [a-z]\{4\} for four lowercase letters then after that a space then [A-Z] for an uppercase Letter.

command: grep ‘[A-Z][a-z]\{4\} [A-Z]’ Grep Lab

8.  Print lines where the address begins with a two or three digit number
(so this would be 12 main st or 123 main street but not 1234 main
street).

you want to start this one with ":" because after the phone numbers the street names start with ":" and then [0-9]\{2,3\} will print the street numbers that have two digits and three digits. 

command: grep ‘:[0-9]\{2,3\} ‘ GrepLab


9. Print lines where the person lives in Mass or Illinois

here you want to use -e before and but the states abbreviations in quotes "MA" and "IL"

command: grep -e “MA” -e “IL” GrepLab 


10.  Print lines containing the addresses that aren’t on a street (You might
see St as shorthand for street)

use -v to make it so lines with "Street" wont show up 

command: grep -v Street GrepLab
